> too long; don't give a fuck

A minimalist web app that displays randomized cheeky responses to send when someone sends you a wall of text. Built with an ironically classy aesthetic.

## What is this?

Send this link to friends when they send you excessively long articles, documents, or messages. Each page load displays a random crude variation of "TL;DR" with style.
